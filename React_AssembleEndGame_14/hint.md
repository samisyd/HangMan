 * Questions to ask yourself before writing any code:
 * 
 * - What are the main containers of elements I need

 * 
 * 
 * - What values will need to be saved in state vs.
 *   what values can be derived from the state?
 * 
 * 
 * - How will the user interact with the app? What
 *   events do I need to handle?
